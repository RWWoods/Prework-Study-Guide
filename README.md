# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is intended to serve as a resource to help learn coding by providing a place to record anything I learn on a webpage I can access anywhere. I created this project to get more familiar with the basics of HTML, JavaScript, Git, and CSS. 


## Installation

## Usage

This project contains notes within each section to help learn HTML, JavaScript, Git, and CSS. Furthermore, using DevTools console we can see the JavaScript running. Using the console the project will select one topic from our prework for us to study, and we can update the project with anything else we learn during bootcamp.
